### Assignment 1 - Random Name Generator

Load a list of first names and last names, and use them to generate full names and to sort namse by either first or last, and to group names by first.

```sh
.\gradlew.bat session1:assignment1 # Windows
./gradlew session1:assignment1 # Mac/Linux
```

Comments on what the code is doing are found in the System.out.print calls.

I can't help but add unicode to make my projects prettier. Apologies in advance.
